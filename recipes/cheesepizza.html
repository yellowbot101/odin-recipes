</p>

<p>Do not feel the need to follow this recipe to its exact specification.
    Add whatever is your favorite cheese, toppings, or any additional seasoning.
    Make the pizza your own!
</p>

<p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
<ul>
    <li>Cheese of choice</li>
    <li>Tomato Sauce of choice</li>
    <li>Dough of choice</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to mimic our recipe, we used prepackaged, store-bought dough;
    a jar of Prego Traditional; and a mix of mozzarella, parmesan, and gouda
    cheese.
</p>

<H2>Steps</H2>
<p>Now, the real fun: how the hell do you make it?? Luckily, the <strong>actual</strong>
process is fairly easy. Just follow along!</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 475 degrees F. (or 245 in C)
    </li>
    <li><strong>Get your dough </strong>and start <em>rolling</em>. You'll want to do your best
    to make yourself a little circle. Sometimes, people will throw it up in the air
like some wizard. We suck at that and instead manually roll it out and then
curl the edges to make the crust.</li>
    <li><strong>Sauce that boy!<strong> You'll want to try and make an even
        spread of the sauce for the most optimal coverage.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Cheese it up!</strong> As they say, <em>"this is where the fun begins."
    </em> Start dropping on that cheese till you feel satisfied. It is probably better
    to do more cheese than less.</li>
    <li><strong>Start cooking.</strong> It should take only 10-15 minutes to cook,
    so you're in luck if you're hungry.</li>
    <li><strong>Let rest and then enjoy!</strong></li>
</ol>
