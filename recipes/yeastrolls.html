<h1>Grandma's Old Fashion Yeast Rolls</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Let the truth be known: my grandmother has never made rolls for me before.
    Sorry to let that truth bomb loose, but it had to be said. In fact, most recipes
    must straight up lie. No way old granny goes, "I call these Grandma's Overcooked Ham."
</p>
<p>
    But here we are, telling lies. You wouldn't have clicked if it was just called
    "Yeast Rolls." That, for some reason, sounds disgusting. But throw in Old-Fashioned
    and bring up your grandmother: poof, I got your click.
</p>

<p>Anyways, here's what you'll need:</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>2 and a half cups of <em>warm</em> water</li>
    <li>1 and a half tablespoons of active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of salt. Exactly, this is <em>crucial!</em></li>
    <li>3/4 cups of shortening (try using Crisco)</li>
    <li>7 cups of all-purpose flour, divided, or more as needed</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of butter, melted</li>
    <li>A grandmother</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    Dissolve yeast in warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook.
    Stir in sugar and salt until you see foam rising. Add 3 cups flour and 3/4 cup shortening;
    mix with the dough hook until the mixture is the consistency of a thick pancake.
